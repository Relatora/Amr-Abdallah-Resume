  authorDescription: `<p style="text-indent: 0px">Full-stack developer, passionate about what I do.</p>
  <p>IT Project Manager and full-stack developer at Industrial Web Apps. Besides managing the team I take absolute pleasure in
  augmenting and reshaping SHORE into a more powerful platform. Working closely with management to bring all of IWA's products to
  their full potential.</p>
 <p>I worked as a software developer at <em>Avaros EMR</em> 
 where I’m doing many exciting things such as integrating Twilio SMS in the scheduler backend using 
 <strong>Go Lang and PostgreSQL. </strong>. Worked as part of a team developing a patient online booking frontend developing 
 frontend components in <strong>ReactJS</strong>. Furthermore, worked on troubleshooting and adding functionality to a 
 <strong>Java</strong> based EMR solution.</p>
 <p>Developed on a very exciting <strong>MERN stack</strong> 
 project for <em>Procor</em> to manage their railcar operations, as well as working as a <strong>Full-stack Developer</strong> 
 at <em>Eye-Look Media</em> where I'm building with a team a digital signage management system</p>
 <p>In 2019 I enrolled in a postgraduate degree at <em>Lambton College</em> CSAC program (Computer Software & Database Development) 
 where I learned many skills that I utilized in projects affiliated with Lambton research center. One of these project 
 was a digital signage <strong>HTML/CSS/JS</strong> compiler that takes in via <em>Express</em> a payload and automatically 
 downloads assets via WebSocket from the web then maps these assets regardless of dimensions or location dynamically to a 
 full screen <strong>Electron JS</strong> browser page on top of a <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> that can 
 be placed behind any screen for display. </p>`,
