  authorDescription: `<p style="text-indent: 0px">Developer, passionate about what I do.</p>
 <p>In 2019 I enrolled in a postgraduate degree at <em>Lambton College</em> CSAC program (Computer Software & Database Development) where I learned many skills that I utilized in projects affiliated with Lambton research center. One of these project was a digital signage <strong>HTML/CSS/JS</strong> compiler that takes in a <strong>JSON</strong> string and automatically downloads assets via WebSocket from the web then maps these assets regardless of dimensions or location dynamically to a full page <strong>Electron JS</strong> browser page and all of that ran on a <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> that can be placed behind any screen for display. </p>
 <p>I worked as a software developer at <em>Avaros EMR</em> where I’m doing many exciting things such as integrating Twilio SMS in the scheduler backend using <strong>Go Lang and PostgreSQL. </strong>. Worked as part of a team developing a patient online booking frontend developing frontend components in <strong>ReactJS</strong>. Furthermore, worked on troubleshooting and adding functionality to a <strong>Java</strong> based EMR solution.</p>
 <p>I'm currently working on a very exciting <strong>MERN stack</strong> project for <em>Procor</em> to manage their railcar operations, as well as working as a <strong>Full-stack Developer</strong> at <em>Eye-Look Media</em> where I'm building with a team a digital signage management system</p>`,
